# 🌟 INTERPOLATION in Angular

**Interpolation** in **Angular** is a **one-way data binding** technique that allows you to display dynamic data from your component class directly within your HTML templates.  
It provides an expressive and intuitive way to embed component data or expressions using double curly braces `{{ }}`, which Angular evaluates and renders as text in the view.

## 🧩 What is Interpolation?

Interpolation acts as a bridge between the **component logic (TypeScript)** and the **template (HTML)**.  
It helps render values dynamically, making your UI reflect the current state of your component data.

```html
<p>{{ expression }}</p>
